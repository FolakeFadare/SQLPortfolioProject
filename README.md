# Covid 19 Data Exploration 

This is an analysis that shows information about covid total number of cases, number of deaths and number of people vaccinated in the world.

Skills used: Joins, Converting Data Types, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, 

# Project Overview

The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from:

Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19)
Research and data: Edouard Mathieu, Hannah Ritchie, Lucas Rod√©s-Guirao, Cameron Appel, Daniel Gavrilov, Charlie Giattino, Joe Hasell, Bobbie Macdonald, Saloni Dattani, Diana Beltekian, Esteban Ortiz-Ospina, and Max Roser
which can be accessed here "https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus"

The data is in an excel sheet

# Data Cleaning
The data set were split into two files:

1. Named CovidDeaths contained the data as regards the cases detected and the reported death counts per day
- Some columns from the original dataset that were not necessary to the covid death analysis were removed

2. Named CovidVaccinations contained the data as regards the number of people vaccinated per day
- Some columns from the original dataset that were notnecessary t the covid vaccination analysis were also excluded.

# Data Processing

The cleaned dataset were imported to SQL for further analysis. The SQL script is uploaded in this repo.

# Data Exploration and Analysis

For CovidDeaths had dataset with 170,342 rows but when the columns with continents as 'null' were removed, we have 162,120 rows which were used for further analysis.
For CovidVaccinations had dataset with 85,171,rows while we worked wih 81,060 rows after excluding the the column continents with null values and were also used for further analysis
